# Test  Automation Engineer - technical assignment

## Overview

Welcome to the Consafe Logistics Test Automation Engineer technical assignment!

Your assignment will be to identify key functionalities of given application, define test cases to validate identified functionalities and create automated test cases implementing earlier defined test scenarios.

## Application source

The application you will be working with can be found in the following public GitHub repository - https://github.com/consafe-logistics/todo-app. Its live version can be found under the following URL - https://wc-react-todo-app.netlify.app/. We would like to recognize the original creator of the application - [Shaif Arfan](https://github.com/ShaifArfan).

We strongly suggest forking the repository and placing source code of automated test cases in the forked repository on your private GitHub account.

## Defining test cases

The application is a slightly more sophisticated TODO items manager. Your job will be to:

- Identify key functionalities of the application
- Define 5 test cases covering key functionalities of the application
- Each test case should contain **at least** the following information:
  - Top-level description of tested functionality
  - Prerequisites (if needed)
  - Steps to execute 
  - Validation criteria
- Add `test-cases.md` file in the root of the repository with test cases you created.

## Test cases automation

- Use testing framework of your choice, Playwright is preferred however feel free to choose different one if you're not comfortable with it.
- All implemented test cases should pass, assume that there are no errors in the implementation.
- Add  `run-instructions.md` with description how to run the test cases locally.
- The project does not use TypeScript, however you can add it if it will make things easier for you.
- Be prepared to explain the test cases implementation details to the technical recruiters at later recruitment stages.
